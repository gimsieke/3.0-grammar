# XProc 3.0 grammar and step library

This repository contains the XProc 3.0 RELAX NG grammar.

Building this repository combines the the core XProc grammar with the
grammar fragments for each of the official step specifications. It
also produces `library.xpl`, a step library for the steps.

The resulting grammar will validate either XProc 1.0 or XProc 3.0.
